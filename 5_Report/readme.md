 # WHO:
   It is the application where we can control the door with the help of switch
 # WHAT:
   HIGH RELIABILITY
 # WHEN:
   IT CAN BE USED ANY TIME
 # WHERE:
   PRESENCE OF NEAR BY OBJECTS
 # HOW:
   EASY TO USE AND ADJUSTED IN A SHORT RANGE
   
 # THREATS:
    . FAILURE OF THE COMPONENTS.
    . Voltmeter should be handled carefully 
   
 # Result:
   When person enters Switch on, door opens and led will glow
