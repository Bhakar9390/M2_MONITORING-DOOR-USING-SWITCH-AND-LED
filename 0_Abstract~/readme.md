# MONITORING DOOR USING SWITCH AND LED

This project is about monitoring the door using a switch and led. when the switch is on the door opens and the led will glow. if the switch is off the door closes and the led will off. for this project, we are using simulide and microchip studio software. for circuit designing, we are using simulide, for running the code we are using microchip studio.The microcontroller is Atmega328.

The Atmel Studio  IDP gives you a seamless and easy-to-use environment to write, build, and debug your applications written in C/C++ or assembly code. It also connects seamlessly to the debuggers, programmers, and development kits that support AVR and SAM devices.
 
SimulIDE is a real-time electronic circuit simulator. It is a simple tool intended for advance learning, and it lets you enjoy the experience as well. SimulIDE is designed to be fast and easy to use, and it works wonders for simple electronics.
